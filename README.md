# Poker Hand Evaluator

This is a Python implementation of Cactus Kev's [Poker Hand Evaluator](http://web.archive.org/web/20130130225356/http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html). I'll be using this evaluator in my Texas Hold'em app which you can check out [here](https://github.com/jviray/texas-holdem).
